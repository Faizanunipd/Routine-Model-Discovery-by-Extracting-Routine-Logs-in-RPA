# Routine-Model-Discovery-by-Extracting-Routine-Logs-in-RPA


This repository presents a methodology to extract routine patterns from unsegmented UI logs. The project utilizes a clustering-based approach to group similar activity segments and reconstruct routine logs. Various clustering techniques including **KMeans**, **DBSCAN**, and **HDBSCAN** were used to identify latent routine structures. The quality of the extracted routines was evaluated using **Jaccard Similarity** and **Fitness Scores** against ground truth models.

## üß† Overview

In scenarios where UI activity logs are not segmented by user sessions or routines, it becomes challenging to discover patterns directly. This project addresses the problem by:

- Assuming all routines are performed by a **single user**
- Segmenting logs using **end-activity heuristics**
- Encoding segments as binary activity vectors
- Clustering encoded vectors to detect **routine patterns**
- Reconstructing and evaluating routine logs

## ‚öôÔ∏è Methodology

### Step 1: Log Preparation and Unsegmentation

All activity logs were treated as if performed by a single user by assigning a common user ID. This was done to simulate cases where user-level data is either anonymized or unavailable.

### Step 2: Segmentation

The unsegmented log is split into segments based on **end-activity markers**. Each segment is assumed to represent an instance of a routine, ending at a pre-defined terminal activity (e.g., `activity_6`).

### Step 3: Activity Vector Encoding

Each segment is encoded into a **binary activity vector**, where:

- Each index in the vector corresponds to a unique activity.
- The value `1` denotes the presence of the activity in the segment.

#### Example

Consider two segments:
- Segment 1 = `{activity_1, activity_3, activity_4}`
- Segment 2 = `{activity_1, activity_2, activity_5}`

Let the activity space be `{activity_1, activity_2, activity_3, activity_4, activity_5}`  
The encoded vectors are:

Segment 1 ‚Üí [1, 0, 1, 1, 0]
Segment 2 ‚Üí [1, 1, 0, 0, 1]


### Step 4: Clustering

These encoded vectors are clustered using the following unsupervised algorithms:

- **KMeans** (specify number of clusters `k`)
- **DBSCAN** (density-based clustering)
- **HDBSCAN** (hierarchical density-based clustering)

Segments with similar activity compositions are grouped into the same cluster, revealing routine similarity.

### Step 5: Routine Pattern Extraction

From each cluster:

- A **representative pattern** (e.g., cluster centroid or frequent pattern) is extracted.
- Each segment is assigned to its corresponding cluster routine.
- Final **routine logs** are reconstructed based on the cluster assignments.

### Step 6: Evaluation

Each reconstructed routine log is compared against the **ground truth routine models** using:

- **Jaccard Similarity Score** ‚Äì measuring set overlap between predicted and actual activity sets.
- **Fitness Score** ‚Äì evaluating the conformance of the routine log with the actual routine model.

## üß™ Example

Given:
- **Activity Space**: `{activity_1, activity_2, activity_3, activity_4, activity_5}`
- **Encoded Vectors**:

S1 ‚Üí [1, 0, 1, 1, 0]
S2 ‚Üí [1, 1, 0, 0, 1]
S3 ‚Üí [1, 0, 1, 1, 0]
S4 ‚Üí [1, 1, 0, 0, 1]

Using KMeans (`k=2`), we may obtain:

- **Cluster 0**: S1, S3 (pattern: [1, 0, 1, 1, 0])
- **Cluster 1**: S2, S4 (pattern: [1, 1, 0, 0, 1])

Resulting routine logs:

- **Routine A** ‚Üí `{activity_1, activity_3, activity_4}`
- **Routine B** ‚Üí `{activity_1, activity_2, activity_5}`
