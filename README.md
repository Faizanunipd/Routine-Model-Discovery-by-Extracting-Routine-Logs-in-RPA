# Routine-Model-Discovery-by-Extracting-Routine-Logs-in-RPA


This repository presents a methodology to extract routine logs from unsegmented UI logs. The project utilizes a clustering-based approach to group similar segments and reconstruct routine logs. Various clustering techniques including **KMeans**, **DBSCAN**, and **HDBSCAN** were used to identify routine logs. The quality of the extracted routine logs was evaluated using **Jaccard Coefficient** and **Fitness Scores** against ground truth models.

## ðŸ§  Overview

In scenarios where UI activity logs are not segmented by user sessions or routines, it becomes challenging to discover patterns directly. This project addresses the problem by:

- Assuming all routines are performed by a **single user**
- Segmenting logs using **end-activity heuristics**
- Encoding segments as binary activity vectors
- Clustering encoded vectors to detect **routine patterns**
- Reconstructing and evaluating routine logs
